*   **Scroll-linked:** Values are linked directly to scroll progress.
    

Motion is capable of both types of animation.

## Scroll-triggered animations

Scroll-triggered animations are just normal animations that fire when an element enters or leaves the viewport.

## [REACT] React: Get started with Motion for React

# Get started with Motion for React

**Motion for React** is a React animation library for building smooth, production-grade UI animations. You can start with simple prop-based animations before growing to layout, gesture and scroll animations.

Motion's unique **hybrid engine** combines the performance of native browser animations with the flexibility of JavaScript. It's also trusted by companies like [Framer](https://framer.com) and [Figma](https://figma.com) to power their amazing no-code animations and gestures.

In this guide, we'll learn **why** and **when** you should use Motion, how to **install** it, and then take a whirlwind tour of its main features.

## Why Motion for React?

React gives you the power to build dynamic user interfaces, but orchestrating complex, performant animations can be a challenge. Motion is a production-ready library designed to solve this, making it simple to create everything from beautiful micro-interactions to complex, gesture-driven animations.

*   Axis control
    
*   Elastic constraints
    
*   Direction locking
    
*   Optional imperative start/stop controls
    

Although browsers provide a native [Drag and Drop API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTML_Drag_and_Drop_API), it can be challenging to create a pleasant experience, with an odd "ghost image" effect. On the other hand, it also contains native dropzone functionality - which isn't yet in Motion.

In this guide we'll take a look at all Motion's drag features and how to customise them.

## [REACT] React: Motion for React Three Fiber

# Motion for React Three Fiber

Motion for React Three Fiber is a simple yet powerful 3D animation library. It offers most of the same functionality as Motion for React, but for declarative 3D scenes.

This guide will help you create animations with Motion for React Three Fiber, but assumes you know the basics of both [Motion for React](/docs/react.md) and [React Three Fiber](https://docs.pmnd.rs/react-three-fiber/getting-started/introduction).

## Install

Motion for React Three Fiber is built upon the [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) and [React Three Fiber](https://docs.pmnd.rs/react-three-fiber/getting-started/introduction) (R3F) libraries. Install all three from npm:

## [REACT] React: Upgrade guide

# Upgrade guide

We strive to reduce the number of breaking API changes but it is occasionally necessary.

The easiest way to upgrade is to start with the version you're currently using, then follow the guide to upgrade to the next version, and so on until you're at the latest version.

Changes between major versions are usually small so this is usually a quick process.

## Motion for React

### 12.0

There are no breaking changes in Motion for React in version 12. Please see the [JavaScript upgrade guide](/docs/upgrade-guide.md) for changes to the vanilla JS API.

# Accessibility

Animations can have serious usability implications, even inducing motion sickness in some people.

All modern operating systems provide a setting called "Reduced Motion", where people can indicate they prefer less physical motion, either because of personal preference or because they can suffer from motion sickness.

There are already some excellent guides about _why_ and _how_ we should design accessible animations, like those at [A List Apart](http://alistapart.com/article/designing-safer-web-animation-for-motion-sensitivity/) and [Smashing Magazine](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2018/04/designing-accessibility-inclusion/). The main takeaways are that for users with "Reduced Motion" enabled, we should keep educational transitions but be aware of motion sickness.

That means replacing transform animations on large elements with opacity transitions, disabling auto-playing videos, and disabling parallax animations.

Motion for React provides APIs that make it simple to respect these people's preferences. In this guide, we'll learn how to use the \

## [REACT] React: Reduce bundle size

# Reduce bundle size

A great web experience doesn't just look and move beautifully, it should load quickly, too.

When measuring the gzipped and minified size of Motion for React using a bundle analysis website like [Bundlephobia](https://bundlephobia.com/package/framer-motion@7.2.0), you might see big numbers like **50kb** or more!

This is misleading. Motion for React exports many functions, most of which you won't import. JavaScript bundlers like [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org/) and [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) are capable of "tree shaking", which means that only the code you import is shipped to consumers.

You may only use a tiny, single hook from Motion for React, like \

## [REACT] React: Motion x Framer integration guide

# Motion x Framer integration guide

[Framer](https://framer.link/pgsExYX) is the world's best no-code website builder. If you have a Framer website, all your animations are already powered by Motion.

Framer offers a number of [animations, interactions and components](https://framer.link/bdH9gwO) that mean you usually never need to write any code to achieve amazing effects.

However, advanced users can write [code components](https://framer.link/MXPS0dB) and [overrides](https://framer.link/bdhlZ3f), which are custom React components that you can drop into your canvas.

The full Motion for React API is available to use in both.

## [REACT] React: Animate your Figma projects with Motion

# Animate your Figma projects with Motion

Figma offers powerful [site-building](https://www.figma.com/sites/) and [code generation](https://www.figma.com/make/) features. Motion is available to use in both.

When adding effects via the Figma Sites Interactions menu, you're generating Motion animations with no-code!

![Screenshot of Figma Sites interface, highlighting Hover effect](https://framerusercontent.com/images/r6kq04Sawfi36eiGmq1gAZS3134.png)

In upcoming versions of Figma, it'll be possible to generate and write your own Motion code into your Figma site.

For now, you can already add Motion code via the [Figma Make](https://www.figma.com/make/) beta.

## Figma Make

Figma Make is an AI code generator that can generate React code from text, image, and Figma artboard prompts.

In general, it will produce Motion code simply by asking it to animate something. For instance, you can give it a screenshot of the [Motion homepage](/) and tell it to animate:

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/I9UrB7u2e1BkL2tS96LYDd7ms.png)

This will produce a code file with Motion already imported:

## [JS] JavaScript: GSAP vs Motion: Which should you use?

# GSAP vs Motion: Which should you use?

When deciding which JavaScript animation library to trust for your project, two libraries often get mentioned because of their feature set and popularity: **Motion** (formerly Framer Motion) and **GSAP** (formerly GreenSock).

Both can create stunning animations, but they have fundamental differences. This guide compares Motion and GSAP on **adoption**, **licensing**, **performance**, and **features** (complete with full comparison table), to help you decide which is right for your project.

## Adoption

Before delving into the libraries themselves, it's helpful to see what other developers are choosing. For modern applications, [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/framer-motion) is a great measure of a library's adoption and momentum.

Here, the numbers are clear: **Motion is growing exponentially,** making it the most-used and fastest-growing animation library in the ecosystem. It even just passed **10 million downloads per month**.

![Graph of Motion npm downloads 2021-2025](https://framerusercontent.com/images/mnKpEm91tNi6LNEueLOI8jxUp5k.png)

## Licensing

Motion is **fully independent** and **MIT open source**. It's financially supported by a mix of incredible industry-leading sponsors like [Framer](https://framer.com), [Figma](https://figma.com), [Sanity](https://www.sanity.io/), [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) and [LottieFiles](https://lottiefiles.com), as well as sales from [Motion+](https://motion.dev/plus).

GSAP, by contrast, is **closed source** and **owned and funded by Webflow**. While it can be used for free in many projects, [its license](https://gsap.com/community/standard-license/) contains a critical restriction: You're prohibited from using GSAP in any tool that competes with Webflow. Furthermore, its license states that **Webflow can terminate it at its discretion**.

With Motion, you have a **guarantee of freedom**. That MIT license is irrevocable. You will never be forced to remove and replace your animation library because of a business decision made by another company. This provides the stability and peace of mind that professional development teams require.

Motion's independence and self-sufficiency also means we work with a broad base of users and companies, creating a library that works for the whole web, rather than the interests of a single company.

## Performance

Performance is more than just smooth animations. It's about providing a flawless 120fps, faster start-up times, and minimal bundle sizes. This is where Motion's modern architecture provides an advantage.

### Hardware accelerated animations

---

## [JS] JavaScript: Migrate from GSAP to Motion

# Migrate from GSAP to Motion

GSAP is an incredible animation library. But, you can achieve all of the same effects using Motion, with hardware accelerated performance, often for a far smaller bundlesize.

Unlike GSAP, Motion doesn't need a costly yearly license to run on commercial websites, as its supported by [corporate sponsors](https://motion.dev/sponsor) and optional Motion+ memberships.

By the end of this guide we'll have learned the benefits and drawbacks of migrating, and also how to migrate basic animations, timeline sequences, scroll-linked and scroll-triggered animations, and React animations.

## Benefits

Motion is built on modern browser APIs like [Web Animations API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Animations_API) (WAAPI) and [Scroll Timeline](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ScrollTimeline), which is what enables it to offer hardware acceleration for common animations like \

---

## [JS] JavaScript: Animation performance

# Animation performance

There are two primary factors that contribute to the performance of a [web animation](/): **rendering**, and **hardware acceleration**.

Rendering is the process of taking an update to the DOM and reflecting that change on screen. This affects the performance of **all animations**.

Hardware acceleration is the ability to run an animation off the main JavaScript thread. This affects the performance of **animations that run at the same time as other JS processes**, like React rendering or other data crunching.

Let's take a deeper look at each.

## Rendering
